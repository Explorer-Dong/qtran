    "Description": [
        "The data type DECIMAL(WIDTH, SCALE) (also available under the alias NUMERIC(WIDTH, SCALE)) represents an exact fixed-point decimal value. When creating a value of type DECIMAL, the WIDTH and SCALE can be specified to define which size of decimal values can be held in the field. The WIDTH field determines how many digits can be held, and the scale determines the amount of digits after the decimal point. For example, the type DECIMAL(3, 2) can fit the value 1.23, but cannot fit the value 12.3 or the value 1.234. The default WIDTH and SCALE is DECIMAL(18, 3), if none are specified.",
        "Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two fixed-point decimals returns another fixed-point decimal with the required WIDTH and SCALE to contain the exact result, or throws an error if the required WIDTH would exceed the maximal supported WIDTH, which is currently 38.",
        "Division of fixed-point decimals does not typically produce numbers with finite decimal expansion. Therefore, DuckDB uses approximate floating-point arithmetic for all divisions that involve fixed-point decimals and accordingly returns floating-point data types.\n\nInternally, decimals are represented as integers depending on their specified WIDTH.",
        "Width\tInternal\tSize (bytes)\n1-4\tINT16\t2\n5-9\tINT32\t4\n10-18\tINT64\t8\n19-38\tINT128\t16",
        "Performance can be impacted by using too large decimals when not required. In particular decimal values with a width above 19 are slow, as arithmetic involving the INT128 type is much more expensive than operations involving the INT32 or INT64 types. It is therefore recommended to stick with a WIDTH of 18 or below, unless there is a good reason for why this is insufficient."
