    "Description": [
        "The previously mentioned integer types all have in common that the numbers in the minimum and maximum range all have the same storage size, UTINYINT is 1 byte, SMALLINT is 2 bytes, etc. But sometimes you need numbers that are even bigger than what is supported by a HUGEINT! In these situations, you can use the BIGNUM type, which stores positive numbers in a similar fashion as other integer types, but uses three additional bytes to store the required size and a sign bit. A number with N decimal digits requires approximately 0.415 * N + 3 bytes when stored in a BIGNUM.",
        "Unlike variable-length integer implementations in other systems, there are limits to BIGNUM: the maximal and minimal representable values are approximately ±4.27e20201778. Those are numbers with 20,201,779 decimal digits and storing a single such number requires 8 megabytes."
