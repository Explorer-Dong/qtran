        "DuckDB supports universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) through the UUID type.",
        "These use 128 bits and are represented internally as HUGEINT values.",
        "When printed, they are shown with lowercase hexadecimal characters, separated by dashes as follows: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab (using 36 characters in total including the dashes).",
        "For example, 4ac7a9e9-607c-4c8a-84f3-843f0191e3fd is a valid UUID.",
        "DuckDB supports generating UUIDv4 and UUIDv7 identifiers.",
        "To retrieve the version of a UUID value, use the uuid_extract_version function.",
        "UUIDv4",
        "To generate a UUIDv4 value, use the uuid() function or it aliases the uuidv4() and gen_random_uuid() functions.",
        "UUIDv7",
        "To generate a UUIDv7 value, use the uuidv7() function.",
        "To retrieve the timestamp from a UUIDv7 value, use the uuid_extract_timestamp function:",
