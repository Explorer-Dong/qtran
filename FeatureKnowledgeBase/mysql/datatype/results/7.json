    "Description": [
        "A normal-size (double-precision) floating-point number. Permissible values are -1.7976931348623157E+308 to -2.2250738585072014E-308, 0, and 2.2250738585072014E-308 to 1.7976931348623157E+308. These are the theoretical limits, based on the IEEE standard. The actual range might be slightly smaller depending on your hardware or operating system.",
        "M is the total number of digits and D is the number of digits following the decimal point. If M and D are omitted, values are stored to the limits permitted by the hardware. A double-precision floating-point number is accurate to approximately 15 decimal places.",
        "DOUBLE(M,D) is a nonstandard MySQL extension; and is deprecated. You should expect support for this syntax to be removed in a future version of MySQL.",
        "UNSIGNED, if specified, disallows negative values. The UNSIGNED attribute is deprecated for columns of type DOUBLE (and any synonyms) and you should expect support for it to be removed in a future version of MySQL. Consider using a simple CHECK constraint instead for such columns."
