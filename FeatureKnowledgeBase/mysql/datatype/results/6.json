    ],
    "Description": [
        "A small (single-precision) floating-point number. Permissible values are -3.402823466E+38 to -1.175494351E-38, 0, and 1.175494351E-38 to 3.402823466E+38. These are the theoretical limits, based on the IEEE standard. The actual range might be slightly smaller depending on your hardware or operating system.",
        "M is the total number of digits and D is the number of digits following the decimal point. If M and D are omitted, values are stored to the limits permitted by the hardware. A single-precision floating-point number is accurate to approximately 7 decimal places.",
        "FLOAT(M,D) is a nonstandard MySQL extension. This syntax is deprecated, and you should expect support for it to be removed in a future version of MySQL.",
        "UNSIGNED, if specified, disallows negative values. The UNSIGNED attribute is deprecated for columns of type FLOAT (and any synonyms) and you should expect support for it to be removed in a future version of MySQL. Consider using a simple CHECK constraint instead for such columns.",
        "Using FLOAT might give you some unexpected problems because all calculations in MySQL are done with double precision. See Section B.3.4.7, “Solving Problems with No Matching Rows”."
