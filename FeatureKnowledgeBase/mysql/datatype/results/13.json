        "A year in 4-digit format. MySQL displays YEAR values in YYYY format, but permits assignment of values to YEAR columns using either strings or numbers. Values display as 1901 to 2155, or 0000.",
        "For additional information about YEAR display format and interpretation of input values, see Section 13.2.4, “The YEAR Type”.",
        "Note",
        "The YEAR(4) data type with an explicit display width is deprecated; you should expect support for it to be removed in a future version of MySQL. Instead, use YEAR without a display width, which has the same meaning."
