    "Feature": [
        "[NATIONAL] CHAR[(M)] [CHARACTER SET charset_name] [COLLATE collation_name]"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "A fixed-length string that is always right-padded with spaces to the specified length when stored. M represents the column length in characters. The range of M is 0 to 255. If M is omitted, the length is 1.",
        "Note",
        "Trailing spaces are removed when CHAR values are retrieved unless the PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH SQL mode is enabled.",
        "CHAR is shorthand for CHARACTER. NATIONAL CHAR (or its equivalent short form, NCHAR) is the standard SQL way to define that a CHAR column should use some predefined character set. MySQL uses utf8mb3 as this predefined character set. Section 12.3.7, “The National Character Set”.",
        "The CHAR BYTE data type is an alias for the BINARY data type. This is a compatibility feature.",
        "MySQL permits you to create a column of type CHAR(0). This is useful primarily when you must be compliant with old applications that depend on the existence of a column but that do not actually use its value. CHAR(0) is also quite nice when you need a column that can take only two values: A column that is defined as CHAR(0) NULL occupies only one bit and can take only the values NULL and '' (the empty string)."
