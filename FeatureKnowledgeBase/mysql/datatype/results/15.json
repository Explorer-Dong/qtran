        "TIMESTAMP"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "A timestamp. The range is '1970-01-01 00:00:01.000000' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07.499999' UTC. TIMESTAMP values are stored as the number of seconds since the epoch ('1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC). A TIMESTAMP cannot represent the value '1970-01-01 00:00:00' because that is equivalent to 0 seconds from the epoch and the value 0 is reserved for representing '0000-00-00 00:00:00', the “zero” TIMESTAMP value.",
        "An optional fsp value in the range from 0 to 6 may be given to specify fractional seconds precision. A value of 0 signifies that there is no fractional part. If omitted, the default precision is 0.",
        "The way the server handles TIMESTAMP definitions depends on the value of the explicit_defaults_for_timestamp system variable (see Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”).",
        "If explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is enabled, there is no automatic assignment of the DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP attributes to any TIMESTAMP column. They must be included explicitly in the column definition. Also, any TIMESTAMP not explicitly declared as NOT NULL permits NULL values.",
        "If explicit_defaults_for_timestamp is disabled, the server handles TIMESTAMP as follows:",
        "Unless specified otherwise, the first TIMESTAMP column in a table is defined to be automatically set to the date and time of the most recent modification if not explicitly assigned a value. This makes TIMESTAMP useful for recording the timestamp of an INSERT or UPDATE operation. You can also set any TIMESTAMP column to the current date and time by assigning it a NULL value, unless it has been defined with the NULL attribute to permit NULL values.",
        "Automatic initialization and updating to the current date and time can be specified using DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP column definition clauses. By default, the first TIMESTAMP column has these properties, as previously noted. However, any TIMESTAMP column in a table can be defined to have these properties."
