    "Description": [
        "A large integer. The signed range is -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. The unsigned range is 0 to 18446744073709551615.",
        "SERIAL is an alias for BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE.",
        "Some things you should be aware of with respect to BIGINT columns:",
        "All arithmetic is done using signed BIGINT or DOUBLE values, so you should not use unsigned big integers larger than 9223372036854775807 (63 bits) except with bit functions! If you do that, some of the last digits in the result may be wrong because of rounding errors when converting a BIGINT value to a DOUBLE.",
        "MySQL can handle BIGINT in the following cases:",
        "When using integers to store large unsigned values in a BIGINT column.",
        "In MIN(col_name) or MAX(col_name), where col_name refers to a BIGINT column.",
        "When using operators (+, -, *, and so on) where both operands are integers.",
        "You can always store an exact integer value in a BIGINT column by storing it using a string. In this case, MySQL performs a string-to-number conversion that involves no intermediate double-precision representation.",
        "The -, +, and * operators use BIGINT arithmetic when both operands are integer values. This means that if you multiply two big integers (or results from functions that return integers), you may get unexpected results when the result is larger than 9223372036854775807."
