    "Feature": [
        "Time64(precision)"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "Time64",
        "Data type Time64 represents a time-of-day with fractional seconds. It has no calendar date components (day, month, year). The precision parameter defines the number of fractional digits and therefore the tick size.",
        "Tick size (precision): 10-precision seconds. Valid range: 0..9. Common choices are 3 (milliseconds), 6 (microseconds), and 9 (nanoseconds).",
        "Syntax:",
        "Time64(precision)",
        "Internally, Time64 stores a signed 64-bit decimal (Decimal64) number of fractional seconds. The tick resolution is determined by the precision parameter. Time zones are not supported: specifying a time zone with Time64 will throw an error.",
        "Unlike DateTime64, Time64 does not store a date component. See also Time.",
        "Text representation range: [-999:59:59.000, 999:59:59.999] for precision = 3. In general, the minimum is -999:59:59 and the maximum is 999:59:59 with up to precision fractional digits (for precision = 9, the minimum is -999:59:59.999999999).",
        "Implementation details\u200b",
        "Representation. Signed Decimal64 value counting fractional second with precision fractional digits.\n\n",
        "Normalization. When parsing strings to Time64, the time components are normalized and not validated. For example, 25:70:70 is interpreted as 26:11:10.",
        "Negative values. Leading minus signs are supported and preserved. Negative values typically arise from arithmetic operations on Time64 values. For Time64, negative inputs are preserved for both text (e.g., '-01:02:03.123') and numeric inputs (e.g., -3723.123).",
        "Saturation. The time-of-day component is capped to the range [-999:59:59.xxx, 999:59:59.xxx] when converting to components or serialising to text. The stored numeric value may exceed this range; however, any component extraction (hours, minutes, seconds) and textual representation use the saturated value.",
        "Time zones. Time64 does not support time zones. Specifying a time zone when creating a Time64 type or value throws an error. Likewise, attempts to apply or change the time zone on Time64 columns is not supported and results in an error."
